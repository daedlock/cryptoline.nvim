<br/>

> **Note** 
> cryptoline.nvim only supports lualine right now. In the future, there will be integration with all popular status bar plugins for neovim. This is a personal project that I developed for myself and I wanted it to make it available to everyone! 


# Installation
## Packer
```
use 'daedlock/cryptoline.vim'
```


<!-- # Configuration (Optional) -->
<!-- By default, the plugin will add BTC, ETH tickers to `section_y` in lualine (refer to screenshot). If you want to customize this behavior and include it in a different section. You can do -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- local cryptoline = require("cryptoline") -->
<!--  -->
<!-- cryptoline.setup({ -->
<!--     lua_line -->
<!-- }) -->
<!-- ``` -->
